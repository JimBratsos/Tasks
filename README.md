# Tasks

I successfully completed the tasks that were asked to me. The first task is basically almost an identical component as the one provided
to me. As for the second part, the functionality is the same with some minor design differences;

1) I tried to design an X button myself that resembled the original one as much as possible. I could not fix the position to be on top
right corner of the button

2) Another problem rising with the 1), is that the text is not 100% center alligned. Fixing 1) will automatically fix 2).

## Made with

I used Vanilla JS, CSS and HTML. I wanted not to use JQuery for the simple reason that this is a task to show my skills in JavaScript. 
JQuery would oversimplify things. Also, it is slowly starting to lose attraction ( although it will not be deprecated anytime soon )
